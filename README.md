[u2dl](https://github.com/Darkhound-org/u2dl) is a cli app made in python üêç that downloads videos from youtube. It processes and displays the streams and the user can select one from it or just type `h` to get the video in highest resolution. Downloaded videos can be further converted to mp3 format. You can specify the download path if you want with the `--save_to` or `-s` option.

## Installation
Users in Windows can download the latest binary from [releases](https://github.com/Darkhound-org/u2dl/releases) [standalone or single executable]. Alternatively, you can clone this repo, make a new `venv`, activate it , run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run the app `u2dl.py`.

### FFmpeg 
u2dl needs FFmpeg library (or just ffmpeg.exe) to convert video to mp3 format. It is recommended to keep the FFmpeg binaries along with the u2dl executable(or script) or add to system path.
